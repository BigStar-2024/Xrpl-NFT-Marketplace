XLS-20d is initially released on the NFT-Devnet in order to allow developers to test NFT capabilities, and server operators to understand the performance characteristics and implications of the proposed changes without compromising the performance of the XRPL.

RippleX is just one contributor to the XRPL – there’s a whole community of independent developers building on it today for its inherent performance advantages and tokenization capabilities. One such project is [Carbonland Trust](https://www.carbonlandtrust.com/), which is pushing the boundaries for potential NFT uses.

In May, RippleX invited the developer community to provide feedback on XRPL's [proposal](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/discussions/46) to enhance NFT support on the XRP Ledger (XRPL).

NFT-Devnet makes it possible for all developers to [learn](https://xrpl.org/nft-conceptual-overview.html) about and experiment with the native NFT capabilities introduced with XLS-20d.

Developers are welcome to start building apps and tokenization use cases, as well as visit the [Technical Tutorial](http://xrpl.org/nftoken-tester-tutorial.html) page to get started.

#### The NFT-Devnet: Getting Started with NFTs on XRPL

Non-fungible tokens serve to encode ownership of physical, non-physical or purely digital goods, such as works of art and in-game items.

The XLS-20d proposal introduces extensions to the XRP Ledger that would support a native NFT type, along with operations to enumerate, transfer and hold such tokens. With XLS-20d [live on XLS-20 Sandbox](https://xrpl.org/nft-conceptual-overview.html) today, developers can access all essential NFT functionality including minting, trading, and burning.
Moreover, advanced features like automatic royalties, which enable more sophisticated royalty structures for creators, and co-ownership, which expands access possibilities to assets, are also built into the proposal.

The NFT-Devnet is a beta environment where developers can preview, test and experiment with XLS-20d on XRPL before it is enabled on the Mainnet.

As this is the first time developers can mint native NFTs on the XRP Ledger, an interactive Technical Tutorial in the documentation on xrpl.org can help them get started. We also encourage developers building NFT projects – or wanting to get started with NFTs – to apply to the XRPL Grants program.

#### Community Spotlight: Carbonland Trust

Earlier this year, Ripple launched the XRPL Grants program – an initiative to engage, fund and support the independent developer community and their technical projects built on the XRP Ledger. Carbonland Trust is one of more than 20 projects to receive funding through the program, focused on protecting forest land with their CO2 Removal Bonded NFTs and Conservation Certificates. The project centers on creating the first CO2 Removal Credit Yielding NFT, a carbon credit producing digital asset and forest conservation DeFi protocol. In addition, the project includes CO2 Bonds which offer businesses and individuals a better way to remove CO2, hedge against rising carbon credit prices, and lock in a stable, long-term supply of high-quality offsets.

Carbonland Trust is one of many projects funded through the XRPL Grants program that will build on the XRPL XLS-20 Sandbox environment.
